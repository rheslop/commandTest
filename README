CommandTest (formerly cmdTest)
==============
v 0.6

CommandTest is a command line based question/answer testing system designed primarily for memorizing user-defined questions.

The first time the application is run, you will be guided to create your first stack (This is stores a sqlite database in .CmdTest/stacks). You can then populate your stack with questions. 

Once a stack is created, it is automatically checked out. If more than one stack of questions is desired, you can switch between stacks. Each stack is a single sqlite database, with a single table.  CommandTest 'remembers' the checked stack by placing an empty file in the same directory, with the same name as the sqlite database without the extension. This means that if you exit and restart CommandTest, the same stack will remain checked out.

Use the settings to modify how a test is taken.

 1. Randomized - Variable
    Any number of questions can be specified, drawing randomly from your stack.  A small buffer of recently asked questions (variable in size, based on number of questions in stack) is kept to ensure the most recent questions are not re-asked.
 2. Randomized - Full
    All questions from your stack are displayed, in random order.
 3. Ordered
    All questions from your stack are displayed, in the order in which they were created.

CommandTest is case sensitive by default, but this behavior can also be changed in settings. Answers MUST match the originally created anA history of scores can be accessed via the main menu.

CommandTest was originally developed as an additional tool to help study for commandline-based practicum tests (Example: Red Hat / Cisco).
