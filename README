CommandTest v0.65
=================

CommandTest is a command line based question/answer testing system designed for memorizing user-defined questions.

CommandTest can be run either by running the ct.py python exectutable file - or if it is installed, by typing 'ct' at the terminal. The first time the application is run, you will need to create your first stack. (This is stores a sqlite database in ~/.CmdTest/stacks, which is created for you). You can then populate your first stack with questions. 

Once a stack is created, it is automatically checked out. (You can have more than one stack of questions and switch between them as desired). The checked out stack, as well as the settings are persistent.

Use the settings to modify how a test is taken.

 1. Randomized - Variable
    Any number of questions can be specified, drawing randomly from your stack. A small buffer of recently asked questions (variable in size, based on number of questions in stack) is kept to ensure the most recent questions are not re-asked.
 2. Randomized - Full
    All questions from your stack are displayed, in random order.
 3. Ordered
    All questions from your stack are displayed, in the order in which they were created.
 4. Multiple Choice
    Any test with four or more questions can be run as a multiple choice test. Not recommended for tests designed for practicum based study.
    Scores for this type of test are not recorded.

CommandTest is case sensitive by default, but this behavior can also be changed in settings. A history of scores can be accessed via the main menu. CommandTest was originally developed as an additional tool to help study for commandline-based practicum tests (Example: Red Hat / Cisco).
